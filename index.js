* Description : For this project, you will build a message 
                generator program. Every time a user runs a 
                program, they should get a new, randomized output. 
                Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of 
                different forms, like an astrology generator, 
                inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To 
                make your program truly random, the message that 
                it outputs should be made up of at least three 
                different pieces of data.
*               Input:  No user input
*               Output: Random message to console
